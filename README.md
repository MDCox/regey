Regey
=========

Regey takes test cases from the user and returns a valid regex for all test cases.

-----
###Dependencies

  - No dependecies other than ruby right now, but will eventually run on rails for a better user experience.


### Current features
 - accepts user input via command line
 - returns regex for general matches only

### To be done
 - Support for more regex features.  Not very useful if you can only match tokens globally.
 - Port to rails with better user interface after more regex features have been added.
